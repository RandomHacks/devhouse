WEB HOOK CONSUMER HACK-IT-UP TOOKIT

Twisted makes writing web servers from scratch pretty easy, but we can make it
easier.  When you really just want to run a little bit of code on a request
Twisted requires you to create a custom Resource class and feed this through a
Site into the reactor as a TCP server -- frack that.

The "consumer" module provides one helper function that can be used as a
decorator to upgrade a single function to a custom Resource and another to
simplify serving it on a given port.

Here's a simple example:

> from consumer import consumer, server
> 
> @consumer
> def dump(request):
>   print request
>   return "thanks!"
> 
> server(dump, 80)

And, if you aren't afraid of decorators doing a little more than decorating,
consider this variant that the module also supports:


> from consumer import easy_consume
> 
> @easy_consume(80)
> def f(request):
>   print request
>   return "whatevz!"
