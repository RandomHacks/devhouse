Before SHDH29:
- Update the print_badge configuration file to define a new badge based on David's stopgap badge design.
- Make a new certificate authority, where the password to the certificate authority's private key is passphrase protected.
- Make the private key for welcome.local password protected if twisted can handle it, otherwise, protect the private key in some other way.
- Make a generic client certificate (not adam.p12)

Sometime soon:
- Rename "tags" back to "badge_tags" so we can store someone's complete or
  general interests in "tags" not just what they feel like showing off for this
  particular event.
- Finish writing the mothership import/export code.
- Agree on what license to release our code under.
- Indicate on the sign-in page when the welcome system is down.
- Make print_badge COMPLETELY general, all configuration should come from the configuration file.
- Add LOTS of documentation to the code.

THE AWESOME FUTURE:
- Add a webhook subscription mechanism wherein people at the even can subscribe to a webhook feed of events.
- Add webhook endpoints to update IRC and Twitter when people arrive.
