Sometime soon:
- Rename "tags" back to "badge_tags" so we can store someone's complete or
  general interests in "tags" not just what they feel like showing off for this
  particular event.
- Finish writing the mothership import/export code.
- Agree on what license to release our code under.
- Indicate on the sign-in page when the welcome system is down.
- Add LOTS of documentation to the code.

THE AWESOME FUTURE:
- Add a webhook subscription mechanism wherein people at the even can subscribe to a webhook feed of events.
- Add webhook endpoints to update IRC when people arrive.
- Jeff: Give names to all the things in the world of webhooks.
