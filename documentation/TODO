Before SHDH29:
- Update the print_badge configuration file to define a new badge based on David's stopgap badge design.
- Make a new certifiate authority, where the password to the certificate authoritie's private key is passphrase protected.
- Make the private key for welcome.local password protected?

Sometime soon:
- Agree on what license to release our code under.
- Indicate on the sign in page when the welcome system is down.
- Make print_badge completely general, all configuration should come from the configuration file.
- Add LOTS of documentation to the code.
- Finish writing the mothership import/export code.
