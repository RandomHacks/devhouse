Name Badges for Events - with all the whistles.  
==========================================

About:
------

This is a tinyhack to print name badges for events, however it is architected to take over the world (see future work section).  You will need to have a local box at the entrance to your event which will run this locally - so if you don't have reliable internet connection, this is perfect for you (but then you probably aren't hosting a Dev House).  There are two screens that the user inputs data in (should take 20 seconds), then they see a thank you screen while their badge is printed out on the label printer.

The original purpose of the name tag is to meet people, so the first name is the loudest/biggest.  However, we have added tags under the last name, so as you are talking with people, categorize them in your brain accordingly.

The label maker this is currently set up for is the "DYNO LabelWriter 400".

Configuration:
--------------

For simple configuration, there are two main files to edit for your event: the welcome.html and the print_badge.config.json files.  The former is the input experience for your user and the latter is what gets printed out on the label maker.

First, edit the /static/welcome.html file. The Welcome Screen for your attendees is the email_form:
* Browser Name of event
* Custom Logo
* Text on the Action Button

After your user inputs a unique identifier (hopefully e-mail) and clicks the action button, they will be directed to the next screen asking for First and Last name, as well as Tags (called details_form).  This shouldn't need to be customized.

After it is complete, the user is kicked to a Thank you page (thanks), and you can choose to put in some custom message to your user here.

* "Thanks for" <insert custom text>", $moniker!"
* You may choose to put a message on this page for the unique social tagging identifier.

The next thing you want to customize is the the layout of the name tag.  In the /badge/configuration/ folder, you will want to put your event_banner.png file as well as your event_sponsor.png file.  Edit the /badge/configuration/print_badge.config.json file to point to your custom event files (in the "file" field of the "background" and "sponsor").

The default size of the banner should be 599px x 60px.  Keep the sponsor logos to 60px height, and adjust the positioning (recommend lower right) as desired by changing the "x" and "y" coordinates in the "sponsor" field.  

You shouldn't have to change the First, Last, or Tag fields - they resize beautifully and work very well.

Please note that the current label maker is in Black and White, so save your images in grey scale to have a better idea what it will look like.

Dependences:
------------

Ensure your local box has the following programs installed:
* GD
* Python GD
* Twisted

Running the Program:
--------------------

You'll need to start your server to get started:

$ ./run_event test_names.dat test_event
$ [enter password]

Get the password from Joel.

Go ahead and check it out on your browser at:

http://localhost:10080

As you input your data, check to ensure that your information has been saved accordingly.  If you haven't hooked up the label printer yet, check the image in the /badge/completed/ folder.  Also, check the rolodex.dat json file it has created in the /data/ folder.
